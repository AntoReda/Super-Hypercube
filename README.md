I added an instructional video on how to setup the application in case you are having issues getting it to work.

In case you don't want to watch the video, simply go to project>>VS2017>>Labs.sln

Once inside, make sure you setup your solution platform to x64 instead of Win32.

The README2 inside the project folder gives credits to all parties involved in this school project and explains the application in more details.

Thanks.
